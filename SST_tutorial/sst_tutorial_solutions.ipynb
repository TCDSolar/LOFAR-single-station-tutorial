From looking at specta one can identify if a source of RFI is long-lived or transient and at what frequency it occurs. In general, I-LOFAR experiences a very quiet radio environment. In order to test this, let's compare I-LOFAR to another station, KAIRA. The Kilpisjärvi Atmospheric Imaging Receiver Array (KAIRA) is a radio telescope located in north-west Finland. It is used for geophysical and astronomical research (Vierinen et al., 2012). It was constructed using the same hardware technology as LOFAR, but is not part of the LOFAR network.\n",
